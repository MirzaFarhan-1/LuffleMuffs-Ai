My Workflow 2: Inquiry Form to Airtable
This repository contains an n8n workflow designed to capture inquiries submitted through a web form and automatically store them in an Airtable base.

‚ú® Features
Web Form Trigger: Easily collect data via a customizable web form.

Airtable Integration: Automatically create new records in a specified Airtable base with submitted form data.

Data Mapping: Maps "Name" and "Inquiry" fields from the form directly to corresponding columns in Airtable.

üöÄ Setup and Configuration
This workflow is an n8n .json file. To use it, you'll need an active n8n instance and an Airtable account.

Prerequisites
An n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud).

An Airtable account with a base and table set up.

Steps
Download the Workflow: Download the My workflow 2 (1).json file from this repository.

Import into n8n:

Open your n8n instance.

Click on "Workflows" in the left sidebar.

Click the "New" button, then select "Import from JSON".

Upload the My workflow 2 (1).json file.

Configure Airtable Credentials:

In the imported workflow, locate the "Create a record" node (Airtable node).

Click on the "Credentials" section.

You'll see a credential named "Airtable Personal Access Token account" (ID: Hkx2qfnTW3Gjn9DS). You need to update this with your own Airtable Personal Access Token.

If you don't have one, create a new credential for Airtable API Key or Personal Access Token in n8n and select it.

Configure Airtable Base and Table:

In the "Create a record" node, ensure the "Base" is set to LuffleMuffs (ID: appuZAApldSXUZCat) and the "Table" is set to Table 1 (ID: tblD4HShcCAMSdWMy).

Important: If your Airtable base/table names are different, update these fields to match your setup. You can select them from the dropdown lists after connecting your Airtable credentials.

Activate the Workflow:

Once configured, click the "Activate" toggle in the top right corner of the n8n workflow editor to make the form live and enable data submission.

üìù Usage
Once the workflow is active:

Access the Form: The "On form submission" node will provide a webhook URL for the inquiry form. You can find this URL by clicking on the node and looking for the "Webhook URL" field in its parameters.

Submit Inquiries: Share this webhook URL (or embed the form generated by n8n) with your users. When they fill out and submit the form, the data will be automatically sent to your Airtable base.

View Records in Airtable: Log in to your Airtable account and navigate to the LuffleMuffs base and Table 1 to see the new inquiry records created by the workflow.

üõ†Ô∏è Customization
Form Fields: You can modify the form fields (e.g., add more fields like "Email", "Phone Number") in the "On form submission" node's parameters. Remember to also update the Airtable node's column mapping if you add new fields.

Airtable Columns: Ensure your Airtable table has columns named "Name" and "Inquiry" (or "Innquiry" as per the current mapping in the JSON) to match the incoming data.

Further Actions: You can extend this workflow by adding more nodes after the Airtable node, such as sending email notifications, integrating with a CRM, or logging data to other services.
